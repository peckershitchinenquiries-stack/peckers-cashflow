/**
 * Add, edit or remove ONE manual cash adjustment on a store's payout week.
 *
 * A week holds as many adjustments as it needs (migration 047) — a supplier
 * paid in cash, a float topped up and a till shortage are three separate facts.
 * Each is a `cash_payout_adjustments` row; their SIGNED SUM is mirrored onto
 * `cash_payouts.adjustment_amount`, which is the only figure the settle maths
 * has ever read. Nothing about how an adjustment applies has changed.
 *
 * One entry point for all three operations because they are the same write:
 *  - no `adjustment_id` → add a new entry (amount 0 is simply nothing to add)
 *  - `adjustment_id` + non-zero amount → edit that entry
 *  - `adjustment_id` + amount 0 → remove it, which is how the sheet deletes one
 *
 * The adjustments live on the payout header, so a week with no sheet yet has
 * one generated for it here rather than the manager being sent away to press
 * Generate first. Idempotent either way: generating is "create or refresh", and
 * it never touches the adjustment columns.
 *
 * Blocked once the payout is confirmed. A locked payout is the record of what
 * was really paid out, and its surplus has already been carried into the next
 * week's opening balance — moving the number afterwards would silently restate
 * a week that is already settled. Unlock it (Super Admin) to amend.
