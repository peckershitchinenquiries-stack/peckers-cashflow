// No server / Supabase imports — safe to use from client UI and server actions
// alike, so the live preview and the persisted payout sheet compute identically.
//
// Core rules (confirmed with the client):
//  - Cash wage uses the NI/bank split: the first `bank_weekly_hours_limit` hours
//    (default 20) of the week are NI/bank wages; only hours ABOVE that are paid
//    in cash, at the employee's hourly_cash_rate.
//  - Drivers are paid hourly like everyone else PLUS a per-delivery petrol
//    allowance, split into SHORT and LONG deliveries each with its own
//    per-driver rate (default £2 when unset). Extra deliveries of each type
//    (logged with a reason) are paid the matching rate.
//  - Wages paid on a Tuesday are for the PREVIOUS week's work (Mon–Sun);
//    the cash used to pay them is what this week's envelopes collected, plus a
//    default supermarket cash float.
//  - Opening balance carries forward last week's surplus.

// NI/cash split (confirmed with the client): NI/bank is a HOME-store concept —

// store runs their NI. A SECONDARY store (one they don't belong to, just cover
